      "The **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)**, also known as a **Kohonen map**, is a type of **artificial neural network (ANN)** that is trained using **unsupervised learning** to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional) discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a **map**.\n",

      "In simpler terms, a SOM is a visualization tool that helps you understand the structure and relationships within high-dimensional data by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional grid, usually a 2D grid. It's like creating a \"map\" where similar data points are clustered together.\n",

      "**Core Idea:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Dimensionality Reduction:** SOMs are excellent for reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving the topological properties of the input space. This means that data points that are close to each other in the high-dimensional input space will also be close to each other on the low-dimensional SOM grid.\n",
      "*   **Clustering and Visualization:** By mapping data to a grid, SOMs effectively group similar data points into clusters. This makes it easier to visualize and interpret complex datasets.\n",

      "1.  **Initialization:**\n",
      "    *   A grid of neurons (nodes) is created, typically in a 2D rectangular or hexagonal lattice.\n",
      "    *   Each neuron has a weight vector associated with it, which has the same dimensionality as the input data. These weight vectors are usually initialized randomly or with small values.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Training Process (Iterative):**\n",
      "    *   **Sampling:** A data point (input vector) is randomly selected from the training dataset.\n",
      "    *   **Best Matching Unit (BMU) Selection:** The algorithm finds the neuron on the grid whose weight vector is \"closest\" to the input vector. This is typically done using a distance metric like Euclidean distance. The neuron with the minimum distance is declared the Best Matching Unit (BMU).\n",
      "    *   **Weight Update:** The weight vector of the BMU and its neighboring neurons are updated to become more similar to the input vector. The amount of update is determined by:\n",
      "        *   **Learning Rate:** A parameter that decreases over time, meaning the updates become smaller as training progresses.\n",
      "        *   **Neighborhood Function:** A function that defines how much the neighbors of the BMU are updated. Neurons closer to the BMU are updated more significantly than those further away. This neighborhood also shrinks over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Convergence:** This process of sampling, BMU selection, and weight update is repeated for many iterations. As training progresses, the weight vectors of the neurons on the grid gradually organize themselves to represent the underlying structure of the input data. Neurons that are close to each other on the grid will have weight vectors that are similar to each other, and these weight vectors will represent clusters of similar input data points.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Components:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Neurons (Nodes):** The fundamental units of the SOM grid. Each neuron has a weight vector.\n",
      "*   **Weight Vectors:** Each neuron has a weight vector with the same dimensionality as the input data. These vectors are adjusted during training.\n",
      "*   **Grid (Lattice):** The arrangement of neurons, typically 2D.\n",
      "*   **Best Matching Unit (BMU):** The neuron whose weight vector is most similar to the current input vector.\n",
      "*   **Learning Rate:** Controls the step size of weight updates.\n",
      "*   **Neighborhood Function:** Determines the influence of the BMU on its neighbors.\n",

      "**Applications of SOMs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "SOMs are used in a wide range of applications, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Data Visualization:** Understanding the structure of high-dimensional datasets.\n",
      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points.\n",
      "*   **Feature Extraction:** Identifying important features in data.\n",
      "*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying data points that are significantly different from the norm.\n",
      "*   **Image Analysis:** Image segmentation, color quantization.\n",
      "*   **Speech Recognition:** Phoneme mapping.\n",
      "*   **Bioinformatics:** Gene expression analysis.\n",
      "*   **Financial Analysis:** Market segmentation, fraud detection.\n",

      "**Advantages of SOMs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Intuitive Visualization:** Provides a clear visual representation of complex data.\n",
      "*   **Preserves Topology:** Maintains the relative relationships between data points.\n",
      "*   **Handles High-Dimensional Data:** Can effectively map high-dimensional data to a lower dimension.\n",
      "*   **Unsupervised:** Does not require labeled data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Disadvantages of SOMs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Requires Parameter Tuning:** The size of the grid, learning rate, and neighborhood function need to be carefully chosen.\n",
      "*   **Can be Computationally Expensive:** Training can take a long time for large datasets.\n",
      "*   **No Explicit Cluster Boundaries:** While it groups data, it doesn't provide explicit boundaries for clusters.\n",
      "*   **Interpretation Can Be Subjective:** The interpretation of the map can sometimes be subjective.\n",

      "### What is a Self-Organizing Map (SOM)?\n",
      "\n",
      "A **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)**, also known as a **Kohonen Map** after its inventor Teuvo Kohonen, is a type of **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** used for **unsupervised learning**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its primary goal is to take high-dimensional data and represent it in a low-dimensional space (usually a 2D grid or map) while preserving the **topological structure** of the original data.\n",
      "\n",
      "In simple terms, an SOM organizes complex data and creates an intuitive map where similar data points are located close to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Core Idea: An Analogy\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you have a big bag filled with thousands of different colored paint swatches (e.g., light red, dark red, orange, deep blue, sky blue, turquoise). Your task is to arrange them on a large, empty canvas so that similar colors are grouped together.\n",
      "\n",
      "An SOM works just like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **The Canvas:** You start with a grid of empty squares (these are the \"neurons\" or \"nodes\" of the map). Each square is initially assigned a random color.\n",
      "2.  **The Process:**\n",
      "    *   You pick a paint swatch (an input data point) from the bag.\n",
      "    *   You find the square on the canvas whose color is *most similar* to your swatch. This is called the **Best Matching Unit (BMU)**.\n",
      "    *   You then \"nudge\" the color of that winning square to be even more like the swatch you're holding.\n",
      "    *   Crucially, you also slightly \"nudge\" the colors of the squares *surrounding* the winner. The closer a square is to the winner, the more its color is changed.\n",
      "3.  **Repeat:** You repeat this process thousands of times with all the paint swatches.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Result:** Over time, the random colors on the canvas will \"organize themselves.\" A region of reds will emerge, blending into oranges, which might be next to yellows. A separate region of blues will form, blending into greens. You've created a \"map\" of colors, preserving the relationships between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is exactly what an SOM does with any kind of data, not just colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### How the Algorithm Works (The Technical Steps)\n",
      "\n",
      "An SOM consists of a grid of nodes. Each node has a **weight vector** which has the same number of dimensions as the input data. For example, if you are mapping customer data with 10 features, each node on the map will have a 10-dimensional weight vector.\n",
      "\n",
      "The training process involves these four steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 1: Initialization**\n",
      "*   Create a grid of nodes (e.g., 10x10).\n",
      "*   Initialize the weight vector of each node with small, random values or by picking samples from the input data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 2: Competition**\n",
      "*   Select one input vector (a single data point) from your dataset.\n",
      "*   Calculate the distance (usually the Euclidean distance) between this input vector and the weight vector of *every node* on the map.\n",
      "*   The node with the smallest distance is declared the winner, the **Best Matching Unit (BMU)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ \\text{BMU} = \\arg\\min_{i} \\| \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{w}_i \\| $$\n",
      "*where $\\mathbf{x}$ is the input vector and $\\mathbf{w}_i$ is the weight vector of node $i$.*\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 3: Cooperation & Adaptation (The Update)**\n",
      "*   The weight vector of the BMU is updated to move it closer to the input vector.\n",
      "*   The weight vectors of the BMU's **neighbors** on the grid are also updated, but by a smaller amount. The farther a neighbor is from the BMU, the less it gets updated.\n",
      "*   This update is governed by a **learning rate** ($\\alpha$) and a **neighborhood function** ($h(i, \\text{BMU})$).\n",
      "\n",
      "The update rule for a node $i$ is:\n",
      "$$ \\mathbf{w}_i(t+1) = \\mathbf{w}_i(t) + \\alpha(t) \\cdot h(i, \\text{BMU}, t) \\cdot (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{w}_i(t)) $$\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Learning Rate ($\\alpha$)**: A value that starts high and decreases over time. This means the map makes big changes at the beginning and fine-tunes itself later.\n",
      "*   **Neighborhood Function ($h$)**: A function (often a Gaussian) where the effect is strongest at the BMU and diminishes with distance. The radius of this neighborhood also shrinks over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 4: Repetition**\n",
      "*   Repeat steps 2 and 3 for many iterations, cycling through the entire dataset multiple times. As the process continues, the learning rate and neighborhood radius shrink, and the map becomes stable and organized.\n",

      "### Key Characteristics\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Unsupervised Learning:** It doesn't need labeled data. It finds patterns on its own.\n",
      "*   **Dimensionality Reduction:** It effectively reduces high-dimensional data to a 2D or 3D map for visualization.\n",
      "*   **Topology Preservation:** This is its most important feature. It maintains the relative relationships between data points. If two data points are similar in the original high-dimensional space, they will be mapped to nearby nodes on the SOM.\n",
      "*   **Visualization:** Its primary use is to create visual representations of complex data, making it easier to understand clusters, outliers, and patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Common Applications\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers with similar purchasing behaviors to create a map of customer profiles.\n",
      "2.  **Data Visualization:** Visualizing complex datasets like census data, financial indicators, or scientific measurements. The famous \"Poverty Map\" is a classic example, showing how countries with similar development indicators cluster together.\n",
      "3.  **Image and Speech Recognition:** Organizing vast libraries of images or sounds based on their features.\n",
      "4.  **Robotics:** Helping robots understand sensory input and map their environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pros and Cons\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "*   Excellent for visualizing the structure of complex, high-dimensional data.\n",
      "*   Relatively easy to understand conceptually.\n",
      "*   Can reveal non-linear relationships and clusters that other methods might miss.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons:**\n",
      "*   The size and shape of the map must be chosen by the user beforehand, which can affect the result.\n",
      "*   It is a visualization and clustering tool, not a predictive model (it doesn't predict a value).\n",
      "*   Can be computationally expensive for very large datasets or large maps.\n",
      "\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Precise Grounding:** Its core feature. It maps every extracted item to its exact character position in the original text, allowing for easy verification.\n",
    "*   **Reliable Structured Output:** Uses examples (few-shot prompting) to ensure the LLM's output consistently follows a predefined format.\n",
    "*   **Adaptable & No Fine-Tuning:** Can be adapted to any domain (e.g., legal, medical) simply by changing the examples and instructions, without needing to retrain a model.\n",
    "*   **Handles Long Documents:** Built to process lengthy texts that might exceed an LLM's standard context window.\n",
    "*   **Flexible LLM Support:** It is model-agnostic and works with various LLMs like Gemini, OpenAI models, and even local open-source models through Ollama.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",

    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
