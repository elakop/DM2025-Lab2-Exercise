      "The **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)**, also known as a **Kohonen map**, is a type of **artificial neural network (ANN)** that is trained using **unsupervised learning** to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional) discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a **map**.\n",

      "In simpler terms, a SOM is a visualization tool that helps you understand the structure and relationships within high-dimensional data by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional grid, usually a 2D grid. It's like creating a \"map\" where similar data points are clustered together.\n",

      "**Core Idea:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Dimensionality Reduction:** SOMs are excellent for reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving the topological properties of the input space. This means that data points that are close to each other in the high-dimensional input space will also be close to each other on the low-dimensional SOM grid.\n",
      "*   **Clustering and Visualization:** By mapping data to a grid, SOMs effectively group similar data points into clusters. This makes it easier to visualize and interpret complex datasets.\n",

      "1.  **Initialization:**\n",
      "    *   A grid of neurons (nodes) is created, typically in a 2D rectangular or hexagonal lattice.\n",
      "    *   Each neuron has a weight vector associated with it, which has the same dimensionality as the input data. These weight vectors are usually initialized randomly or with small values.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Training Process (Iterative):**\n",
      "    *   **Sampling:** A data point (input vector) is randomly selected from the training dataset.\n",
      "    *   **Best Matching Unit (BMU) Selection:** The algorithm finds the neuron on the grid whose weight vector is \"closest\" to the input vector. This is typically done using a distance metric like Euclidean distance. The neuron with the minimum distance is declared the Best Matching Unit (BMU).\n",
      "    *   **Weight Update:** The weight vector of the BMU and its neighboring neurons are updated to become more similar to the input vector. The amount of update is determined by:\n",
      "        *   **Learning Rate:** A parameter that decreases over time, meaning the updates become smaller as training progresses.\n",
      "        *   **Neighborhood Function:** A function that defines how much the neighbors of the BMU are updated. Neurons closer to the BMU are updated more significantly than those further away. This neighborhood also shrinks over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Convergence:** This process of sampling, BMU selection, and weight update is repeated for many iterations. As training progresses, the weight vectors of the neurons on the grid gradually organize themselves to represent the underlying structure of the input data. Neurons that are close to each other on the grid will have weight vectors that are similar to each other, and these weight vectors will represent clusters of similar input data points.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Components:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Neurons (Nodes):** The fundamental units of the SOM grid. Each neuron has a weight vector.\n",
      "*   **Weight Vectors:** Each neuron has a weight vector with the same dimensionality as the input data. These vectors are adjusted during training.\n",
      "*   **Grid (Lattice):** The arrangement of neurons, typically 2D.\n",
      "*   **Best Matching Unit (BMU):** The neuron whose weight vector is most similar to the current input vector.\n",
      "*   **Learning Rate:** Controls the step size of weight updates.\n",
      "*   **Neighborhood Function:** Determines the influence of the BMU on its neighbors.\n",

      "**Applications of SOMs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "SOMs are used in a wide range of applications, including:\n",

      "*   **Data Visualization:** Understanding the structure of high-dimensional datasets.\n",
      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points.\n",
      "*   **Feature Extraction:** Identifying important features in data.\n",
      "*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying data points that are significantly different from the norm.\n",

      "*   **Requires Parameter Tuning:** The size of the grid, learning rate, and neighborhood function need to be carefully chosen.\n",
      "*   **Can be Computationally Expensive:** Training can take a long time for large datasets.\n",
      "*   **No Explicit Cluster Boundaries:** While it groups data, it doesn't provide explicit boundaries for clusters.\n",
      "*   **Interpretation Can Be Subjective:** The interpretation of the map can sometimes be subjective.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "How would you do it? You'd probably start by placing similar colors together. All the reds would go in one corner, the blues in another, and the greens somewhere else. The colors in between, like orange, would be placed between red and yellow.\n",

      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### How the Algorithm Works: The Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "The SOM consists of a grid of nodes (neurons). Each node has a \"weight vector\" which has the same number of dimensions as the input data. Initially, these weight vectors are set to random values.\n",
      "\n",
      "The training process is **competitive and cooperative**:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. Initialization\n",
      "*   Create a grid of nodes (e.g., 10x10).\n",
      "*   Initialize the weight vector for each node with random values. The dimension of these vectors must match the dimension of your input data (e.g., if your data has 15 features, each weight vector will have 15 values).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Competition\n",
      "*   **Select a random data point** from your training dataset.\n",
      "*   Compare this data point to the weight vector of **every node** on the map.\n",
      "*   The node whose weight vector is most similar to the input data point is declared the **Best Matching Unit (BMU)** or the \"winning\" node. Similarity is typically measured using Euclidean distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Cooperation & Adaptation (The \"Self-Organizing\" Part)\n",
      "This is the most crucial step. Not only does the BMU get updated, but its neighbors on the grid do as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Update the BMU:** The BMU's weight vector is \"nudged\" to be even closer to the input data point it just won.\n",
      "*   **Update the Neighbors:** The nodes physically close to the BMU on the grid are also updated to become more like the input data point, but by a smaller amount. The farther a neighbor is from the BMU, the less it gets updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "This \"neighborhood\" effect is what forces the map to organize itself. When a red-like data point is presented, the BMU and its neighbors all become a little more \"red.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. Iteration\n",
      "*   Repeat steps 2 and 3 for many iterations, picking a new random data point each time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over time, two important parameters are gradually reduced:\n",
      "*   **Learning Rate:** The size of the \"nudge\" or update. It starts large to allow for major organization and becomes smaller for fine-tuning.\n",
      "*   **Neighborhood Radius:** The size of the neighborhood around the BMU that gets updated. It starts large, affecting a large portion of the map, and shrinks over time so that updates become more localized.\n",
      "\n",
      "After thousands of iterations, the map stabilizes, and a smooth, organized representation of the input data emerges.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### What is it Used For? (Applications)\n",
      "\n",
      "SOMs are powerful for exploratory data analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Data Visualization:** This is its primary use. You can visualize a 100-dimensional dataset on a 2D map, where clusters and relationships become immediately apparent. For example, you could map customer data and see distinct groups of customers emerge on the map.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Clustering:** Once the map is trained, you can see which areas of the map correspond to which types of data. The nodes on the map naturally form clusters. This is similar to k-means but can capture more complex, non-linear relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Dimensionality Reduction:** Like PCA or t-SNE, it reduces dimensions, but its focus is on preserving the topology (the neighborhood relationships) of the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Anomaly Detection:** Data points that are very different from the rest of the training data will not have a clear BMU. The distance to the closest BMU will be very large, flagging it as a potential outlier or anomaly.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Image Analysis:** Used for color quantization or segmenting images based on texture and color.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Advantages:\n",
      "*   **Intuitive Visualization:** Easy to understand the structure of complex data.\n",
      "*   **Unsupervised:** Does not require labeled data.\n",
      "*   **Preserves Topology:** Understands the relationships *between* clusters, not just the clusters themselves.\n",
      "*   **Handles Non-Linear Data:** Can capture complex structures that linear methods like PCA might miss.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Disadvantages:\n",
      "*   **Computationally Expensive:** Training can be slow for large datasets or large maps.\n",
      "*   **Requires Hyperparameter Tuning:** The map size, learning rate schedule, and neighborhood function must be chosen carefully.\n",
      "*   **Not a Generative Model:** It doesn't learn a probability distribution of the data; it just provides a discrete mapping.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the **Self-Organizing Map** is a powerful algorithm that organizes complex data onto a simple 2D map, making it an invaluable tool for anyone looking to explore and understand the hidden structure within their data.\n"

    "\n",
    "*   **Precise Grounding:** Its core feature. It maps every extracted item to its exact character position in the original text, allowing for easy verification.\n",
    "*   **Reliable Structured Output:** Uses examples (few-shot prompting) to ensure the LLM's output consistently follows a predefined format.\n",
    "*   **Adaptable & No Fine-Tuning:** Can be adapted to any domain (e.g., legal, medical) simply by changing the examples and instructions, without needing to retrain a model.\n",
    "*   **Handles Long Documents:** Built to process lengthy texts that might exceed an LLM's standard context window.\n",
    "*   **Flexible LLM Support:** It is model-agnostic and works with various LLMs like Gemini, OpenAI models, and even local open-source models through Ollama.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
