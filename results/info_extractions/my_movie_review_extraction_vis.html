Historical dramas — in particular those centered on
fearless feats of resistance against authoritarian regimes
— often seek to be warnings. The oft-quoted Winston
Churchill line — “Those that fail to learn from history are
doomed to repeat it” — may ring simply too facile. Yet in
watching a lm like Jiří Mádl’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">handsomely mounted
period drama</span> “Waves,” one cannot help but see in its
story, and in the history it’s retelling, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">an urgent plea
about the pressing need for a free press</span>. But within its
thriller-like trappings is also <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a complicated meditation
on how such a demand rests on the shoulders of men
and women who are human, and therefore fallible</span>.

“Waves” opens with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">an unequivocal historical truth</span>:
“The Soviet Union keeps Eastern European countries
under its control,” a voice informs viewers as images of
Joseph Stalin, the U.S.S.R. and the aforementioned
countries and peoples (including those of targeted and
executed political prisoners) ash on the screen. “Any
sign of freedom is suppressed by force,” this short
prologue states, setting the tone for the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">rightfully
paranoid atmosphere</span> that “Waves” soon plunges into.
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Media censorship — and the fear it distills and depends
on — is rampant.</span> The year is 1967 in Czechoslovakia and
in that country there is no larger media organization
than Czechoslovak Radio.
Set in the run up to the Warsaw Pact invasion of
Czechoslovakia, “Waves” is most fascinated with the way
those working at the International News Ofce at
Czechoslovak Radio <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">served as a last standing bulwark
against the authoritarianism</span> that would eventually fully
take over in 1968, when tanks and troops tamped down
on any open dissidence to the Communist Party of
Czechoslovakia. As a point of entry to that history, Mádl
introduces the ctional character of Tomáš (Vojtěch
Vodochodský). He’s an everyman who unwittingly nds
himself working at the radio station and witnessing
rsthand how journalist luminary Milan Weiner
(Stanislav Majer) <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">righteously stands his ground against
state-sanctioned censorship and intimidation</span>.
ADVERTISEMENT
Like many citizens who listen raptly to his every word,
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Tomáš is awed by Weiner</span>. But unlike his younger brother
Pavel (Ondřej Stupka), who goes out into the streets in
protest and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">sees in such activities a powerful sense of
civic duty he must abide by</span> (and which <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Weiner rightly
represents</span>), <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Tomáš is more skittish. More prudent. More
pragmatic, perhaps.</span> He’s the kind of citizen who’s eager
to put his head down and make sure he has food to put
on the table as he cares for his brother. He doesn’t see
himself having either the privilege nor the principles to
personally involve himself in the resistance his new
place of employment becomes a symbol for.
No sooner has Tomáš begun working at the radio station
than Weiner and his team begin to more forcefully push
back against the news coming out of the Soviet Union
and the Czechoslovakian government itself. Weiner soon
makes clear he’s not about to be a mere cog in the
propaganda machine his boss would have him be. His
beliefs put him and his team in the crosshairs of a
government and a military who are becoming
increasingly hostile to those who do not toe the party
line. When a recording of what really took place at a
student protest arrives in their ofce, Weiner and his
colleagues (not to mention Tomáš, who’s been recruited
by State Security to inform on the radio’s activities) have
to weigh how far they will go to shine a spotlight on the
truth. And whether their own livelihood and sense of
security is worth such a risk. 
“Waves” unfolds like a ticking time bomb of a spy
thriller. Filip Malásek’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">editing deserves praise for
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">keeping an edge-of-seat tempo</span></span>, even as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the</span> story plays
out exactly as you know it will. Tested loyalties and cat-
and-mouse chases set the stage for the brave work
Czechoslovak Radio’s journalists accomplished in the
year leading up to the invasion. The lm’s pulse-
pounding rhythms (alternately scored by 1960s pop
songs and Simon Goff’s stunning compositions) soon
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">make it feel like a gripping John Le Carré tale</span>. The
freedom of the press is here no mere abstract concept;
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it’s an embodied moral imperative</span> that rests on
professionals who constantly had to make tough
personal choices that could put them at odds with
colleagues, friends and even family. 
ADVERTISEMENT
Anchoring this tale in the perspective of Tomáš, Mádl
makes the moral clarity of the likes of Weiner — and
even the more pragmatic approach of someone like Věra
Šťovíčková (Tatiana Pauhofová), a key gure in the anti-
occupation broadcast that serves as the climactic event
in the lm — <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">feel all the more powerful</span>. This is no
hagiographic portrait of Czechoslovak Radio as a beacon
of civic resistance. It is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a grounded, humanist work</span> of
how difcult it can be to make moral choices in the face
of authoritarianism.
Led by its <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">stellar ensemble</span>, “Waves” makes for <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a</span> eet-
footed period drama, the kind whose <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">straightforward
narrative</span> is heightened by its <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">stylistic and narrative
con</span>dence. Those familiar with the history of the 1968
occupation may know how things will turn out. But Mádl
isn’t solely interested in chronicling that pivotal year.
He’s memorializing a historic moment that resonates in
2024, precisely because its central themes have not, in
the decades since, become historical ones. If anything
they’ve become all the more urgent for it.
