Variety and the\nFlying V logos are trademarks of Variety Media, LLC.\nHistorical dramas — in particular those centered on\nfearless feats of resistance against authoritarian regimes\n— often seek to be warnings. The oft-quoted Winston\nChurchill line — “Those that fail to learn from history are\ndoomed to repeat it” — may ring simply too facile. Yet in\nwatching a lm like Jiří Mádl’s handsomely mounted\nperiod drama “Waves,” one cannot help but see in its\nstory, and in the history it’s retelling, an urgent plea\nabout the pressing need for a free press. But within its\nthriller-like trappings is also a complicated meditation\non how such a demand rests on the shoulders of men\nand women who are human, and therefore fallible.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRelated Stories\nJames Van Der Beek Says Weight Loss at\n'Dawson's Creek' Reunion 'Was Not Cancer\nRelated,' Cries Over Family Getting a\nStanding Ovation From Fans\n“Waves” opens with an unequivocal historical truth:\n“The Soviet Union keeps Eastern European countries\nunder its control,” a voice informs viewers as images of\nJoseph Stalin, the U.S.S.R. and the aforementioned\ncountries and peoples (including those of targeted and\nexecuted political prisoners) ash on the screen. “Any\nsign of freedom is suppressed by force,” this short\nprologue states, setting the tone for the rightfully\nparanoid atmosphere that “Waves” soon plunges into.\nMedia censorship — and the fear it distills and depends\non — is rampant. The year is 1967 in Czechoslovakia and\nin that country there is no larger media organization\nthan Czechoslovak Radio.\nSet in the run up to the Warsaw Pact invasion of\nCzechoslovakia, “Waves” is most fascinated with the way\nthose working at the International News Ofce at\nCzechoslovak Radio served as a last standing bulwark\nagainst the authoritarianism that would eventually fully\ntake over in 1968, when tanks and troops tamped down\non any open dissidence to the Communist Party of\nCzechoslovakia. As a point of entry to that history, Mádl\nintroduces the ctional character of Tomáš (Vojtěch\nVodochodský). He’s an everyman who unwittingly nds\nhimself working at the radio station and witnessing\nrsthand how journalist luminary Milan Weiner\n(Stanislav Majer) righteously stands his ground against\nstate-sanctioned censorship and intimidation.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLike many citizens who listen raptly to his every word,\nTomáš is awed by Weiner. But unlike his younger brother\nPavel (Ondřej Stupka), who goes out into the streets in\nprotest and sees in such activities a powerful sense of\ncivic duty he must abide by (and which Weiner rightly\nrepresents), Tomáš is more skittish. More prudent. More\npragmatic, perhaps. He’s the kind of citizen who’s eager\nto put his head down and make sure he has food to put\non the table as he cares for his brother. He doesn’t see\nhimself having either the privilege nor the principles to\npersonally involve himself in the resistance his new\nplace of employment becomes a symbol for.\nNo sooner has Tomáš begun working at the radio station\nthan Weiner and his team begin to more forcefully push\nback against the news coming out of the Soviet Union\nand the Czechoslovakian government itself. Weiner soon\nmakes clear he’s not about to be a mere cog in the\npropaganda machine his boss would have him be. His\nbeliefs put him and his team in the crosshairs of a\ngovernment and a military who are becoming\nincreasingly hostile to those who do not toe the party\nline. When a recording of what really took place at a\nstudent protest arrives in their ofce, Weiner and his\ncolleagues (not to mention Tomáš, who’s been recruited\nby State Security to inform on the radio’s activities) have\nto weigh how far they will go to shine a spotlight on the\ntruth. And whether their own livelihood and sense of\nsecurity is worth such a risk. \n“Waves” unfolds like a ticking time bomb of a spy\nthriller. Filip Malásek’s editing deserves praise for\nkeeping an edge-of-seat tempo, even as the story plays\nout exactly as you know it will. Tested loyalties and cat-\nand-mouse chases set the stage for the brave work\nCzechoslovak Radio’s journalists accomplished in the\nyear leading up to the invasion. The lm’s pulse-\npounding rhythms (alternately scored by 1960s pop\nsongs and Simon Goff’s stunning compositions) soon\nmake it feel like a gripping John Le Carré tale. The\nfreedom of the press is here no mere abstract concept;\nit’s an embodied moral imperative that rests on\nprofessionals who constantly had to make tough\npersonal choices that could put them at odds with\ncolleagues, friends and even family. \nADVERTISEMENT\nAnchoring this tale in the perspective of Tomáš, Mádl\nmakes the moral clarity of the likes of Weiner — and\neven the more pragmatic approach of someone like Věra\nŠťovíčková (Tatiana Pauhofová), a key gure in the anti-\noccupation broadcast that serves as the climactic event\nin the lm — feel all the more powerful. This is no\nhagiographic portrait of Czechoslovak Radio as a beacon\nof civic resistance. It is a grounded, humanist work of\nhow difcult it can be to make moral choices in the face\nof authoritarianism.\nLed by its stellar ensemble, “Waves” makes for a eet-\nfooted period drama, the kind whose straightforward\nnarrative is heightened by its stylistic and narrative\ncondence. Those familiar with the history of the 1968\noccupation may know how things will turn out. But Mádl\nisn’t solely interested in chronicling that pivotal year.\nHe’s memorializing a historic moment that resonates in\n2024, precisely because its central themes have not, in\nthe decades since, become historical ones. If anything\nthey’ve become all the more urgent for it.\nRead More About: Best International Feature Film, Jiri Madl,\nWaves\n‘Waves’ Review: Jiří Mádl’s Drama on the End of the Prague\nSpring Marks a Timely Portrait of the Power of Principled\nJournalists\nReviewed online, Oct. 25, 2024.
